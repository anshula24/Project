        "With the aim at increasing sales and enhancing customer experiences, Amazon's product recommendation system suggests products to users that are most likeliy to purchase. However, biased recommendation systems bring disrepute to one or more users or products due to unfair exposure, thereby losing revenues and damaging the brand reputation happens.\n",

While these tactics ensured that lesss popular products are viewed at least a little while, they did not learn what users liked and did not permit us to adjust the trade-off between relevance and diversity.\n",

This allowed us to adjust the system to find the optimal trade-ff between fairness (product discoverability) and recommendation quality for our business needs."
