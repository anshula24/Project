# Project

This repository brings together the projects I’ve built across machine learning, applied AI, and large language model (LLM) development. Each project reflects my hands-on approach from data cleaning and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and insight generation.

Along with traditional ML techniques like classification, forecasting, recommendation systems, and emotion recognition, I’ve also worked with LLMs, vector embeddings, RAG pipelines, and prompt engineering. These projects highlight my skills in Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, and modern AI workflows involving LangChain, FAISS, and multimodal analysis.

Overall, this collection represents my learning journey, curiosity, and passion for creating impactful, data-driven solutions using both classical ML and cutting-edge LLM technologies.
